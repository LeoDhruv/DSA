# 🚀 DSA Practice from Scratch

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) journey!  
This is where I start small, stay consistent, and grow stronger — one problem at a time.

---

## 🧠 Why this?

Because solving DSA problems sharpens thinking, improves coding skills, and prepares you for:
- Coding interviews 👨‍💻
- Competitive programming 💻
- Problem-solving in general 🧩

---

## 🛠️ What I'm doing

- Practicing daily with C++
- Starting from basics and going up to advanced topics
- Solving problems using different approaches:  
  👉 Brute Force → Better → Optimal  
- Staying consistent (even on tough days!)

---

## 📌 Resources I follow

- Striver’s A2Z Sheet  
- LeetCode  
- YouTube playlists (Take U Forward etc.)

## 💬 Motto

> "DSA is not just about code, it’s about how you think."  

Let’s build that logic muscle, one line of code at a time. 🚴‍♀️💻
